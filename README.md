# Semantic Clustering of Italian Political News on Facebook

This repository contains the code and data supporting the working paper "[Semantic Clustering of Italian Political News on Facebook: Comparing text-embedding-3-large and UmBERTo Embeddings using HDBSCAN and K-means](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/2j9ed)".

## Overview

This study compares the performance of OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model against the BERT-based UmBERTo model for clustering Italian political news content. We utilize two distinct datasets of political news stories circulated on Facebook before the 2018 and 2022 Italian elections.
